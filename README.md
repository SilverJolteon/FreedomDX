    > Pressing Circle while sitting in the Gathering Hall now provides a quick buff to HP and Stamina. The amount depends on how many chefs you have. `HP = +10 per active Chefs`, `Stamina = +25 for 1 to 4 Chefs or +50 for 5 Chefs`. It will not activate any Felyne Skills, and cannot be used alongside a meal, it is **either or**. Configurable. Ported by SilverJolteon from IncognitoMan's FUC
  - ### Integrated Dos Connection Bonuses
    > Integrates all of the bonuses normally received when connecting Monster Hunter Portable to Monster Hunter 2 Dos. Configurable. By SilverJolteon

  - ### English Menu Patch (Portable)

  - ### English Quest Patch (Portable)
    > Translates non-event quests into English. By SilverJolteon


## Usage
Place the `FDXDAT` folder in `ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/` and apply the ISO patch with [DeltaPatcher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/) to your respective version.

Unlike my EventQuestLoader, event quests are now stored in `FDXDAT/EVENT.BIN`.

## Config Editor
Use [this](https://silverjolteon.github.io/FreedomDX/config_editor.html) online tool to make edits to your CONFIG.BIN.
